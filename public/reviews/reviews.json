I run a business at home and I have no time for a computer that's not set up or working properly. This will never again be a concern thanks to Chris. He's prompt, polite, most competent and most helpful when it comes to directing me towards the best course of action. Although he only worked for me for a few hours, I'm proud to consider him an employee. I have a feeling well be hearing from one another quite frequently."

Second, Chris resolved my problem very quickly, taking more time than he charged me to ensure it was properly fixed - and he did an excellent job, as my laptop is working better than ever! Last, with his recommendation regarding PC security, I am now able to protect my laptop while spending less money. Thank you, Chris!"
